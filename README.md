# Machine Learning–Based Detection of Advanced Persistent Threats in Smart City IoT Environments

This repository contains my MSc Cybersecurity research project on detecting **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** in smart city IoT networks using **machine learning**.  
The work explores the use of **LSTM autoencoders, CNN–LSTM hybrids, and XGBoost** for anomaly detection and attack classification on the **Edge-IIoTset dataset**.

## 📌 Abstract
Smart cities depend on IoT infrastructures such as traffic signals, surveillance cameras, and environmental sensors. These systems are highly vulnerable to stealthy, multi-stage **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** that traditional intrusion detection systems fail to catch.  
This project develops and evaluates a **lightweight, real-time detection framework** deployable at the IoT edge, combining anomaly detection and supervised learning to achieve high accuracy and low latency.

## 🚀 Features
- **LSTM Autoencoder** – unsupervised anomaly detection of rare/unknown attacks.  
- **CNN–LSTM Hybrid** – captures spatial–temporal attack patterns.  
- **XGBoost** – efficient flow-level classification with interpretability.  
- **Federated Learning Design** – distributed model training without raw data sharing.  
- **Edge Deployment Considerations** – optimized for Raspberry Pi-class devices.

## 📊 Dataset
The models are trained and evaluated on **Edge-IIoTset**, a comprehensive IoT/IIoT security dataset that includes multi-stage attacks and realistic smart-city scenarios.
